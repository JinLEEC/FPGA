# LED Counter using Xilinx Clock IP

## Proejct Description
This project implements an LED counter on an FPGA using Xilinx clock IP to generate different clocks.
The 4-bit counter counts with different speeds depending on the input switches.

## Features
- Generate four different clocks
- 4-bit counter connected to LEDs
- Each switch controls a different clock

## Notes
- Tested on Arty A7-100T
- .xci file should be generated in Vivado
